                                          What is SH Game Hub?
                                 _____________________________________

The SH stands for Self Hosted, as such, Self Hosted Game Hub is very much what it sounds like. It's
your personal hub for all of your games. Think Steam, Playnite, etc. Your DRM-free games, in your
own personal store, sitting on your own server, ready-to-go when you are.

                                       Why another game library?
                                 _____________________________________

You might be thinking "aren't there other game libraries similar to this out there?" If you are, you
would not be entirely wrong. There are a couple of others. However, for one reason or another I kept
finding myself having problems. Installing, setting up, or using them. This could be user error, and
even if it's not, I'm not faulting the others especially since they are in active development. So I
decided to try my hand at making my own application to do just what I want, hopefully as smoothly
and effortlessly as one possibly can.

What's next?

Well, I have to finish it and get everything up and running properly, then I plan to share it! Once
I have myself and others testing it in production, I plan on writing up a quick tutorial, knocking
out any bugs or issues we come across, and then it should be stable. Once stable I plan on leaving
it as-is until it requires a patch or I decide to add another feature.

So stay tuned!
